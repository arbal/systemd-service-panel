# systemd-service-panel
A simple graphic front-end for managing systemd services running on your computer or server. Allows you to monitor service status in real time, start/stop services and enable/disable services at boot.

Written in Python3 using curses to make the interface, so it should run on any system the can run systemd. Requires `dbus` and `python3-dbus`.
